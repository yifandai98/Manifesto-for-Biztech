# Manifesto-for-Biztech

##Context
Since the advent of the **pandemic**, we have gradually acclimated to a _new form of living_ -- from attending fully remote courses to working at home for traditionally on-site jobs. The pandemic has compelled us to ponder in new perspectives, how we interact and socialize with others, while abiding guidelines for maintaining an apt social distance. It has also prompted us to think about the future of our personal and professional lives, how technology is changing our ways of communication and interaction. We believe that understanding these changes is pivotal in every student's preparation for their prospective careers, regardless of the discipline, and we seek to offer a platform where they are able to explore the _various topics_ and engage in an interactive environment that fosters both their personal and professional developments.

##Event details
The Biztech is the TBAâ€™s **biggest annual signature event**, which provides a platform for students at UW to connect with professionals from industries. This year we are expecting around **300** students from in and outside of UW attending 2021 Biztech forum. In addition, we plan to invite **3 to 4 panelists** each to 4 different rooms, or **12 to 16** in total, with their selected topic of interest from one of the possible subtopics: **Data Science**_(Feb 28th 6-7:30 pm PST)_, **Healthcare**_(Feb 27 6 - 7:30 pm PST)_, **Investing**_(Feb 28 6-7:30 pm PST)_, **Online Education**_(Feb 27 6-7:30 pm PST)_. The event merges _panel talks_, _breakout rooms discussion_, and _free networking session_ together for a more interactive learning experience.

##Why us?
The technology and Business Association was founded in Seattle as a _non-profit_ organization in _March 2013_ by a group of UW students. We have about **1600** members in the Seattle area and **400** members in Minnesota. We aim to promote **connections** between UW students and the professionals in the Great Seattle Area and to offer smooth transitions between _academic and different industries_.
